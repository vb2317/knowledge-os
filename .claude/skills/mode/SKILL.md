Read the current mode from ~/.claude/current-mode.

If an argument is given ("pm", "engineering", or "engg"), write it to ~/.claude/current-mode and confirm. Treat "engg" as an alias for "engineering".

If no argument, show the current mode and ask which to switch to.

After switching to PM mode: apply a product management lens this session — start with problem framing, user impact, and outcome definition before implementation. Reference pm/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md and pm/PM_NOTEBOOK.md.

After switching to Engineering mode: standard engineering focus — clean code, tests, architecture.

Always confirm what mode is now active and what changes about how you'll approach work.
