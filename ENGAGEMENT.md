# ENGAGEMENT.md - HN Engagement Strategy

## Philosophy

**Goal:** Strategic HN presence, not volume. High-signal contributions that compound into reputation and network.

**Your advantage:** Systems thinking + domain depth (ML, data science, knowledge graphs, parenting philosophy). You see patterns others miss.

**Constraint:** Time. Engagement must be frictionless and high-ROI.

## Engagement Digest Architecture

### New Section: "🎯 Engagement Opportunities"

Daily digest adds a third section after stories:

```
🦅 HN Digest - [Date]

📚 Stories Matched (existing)
- [current format]

🎯 Engagement Opportunities (NEW)
- [opportunities below]

👤 Author Watch (existing)
- [current format]
```

### Opportunity Types

#### 1. **Ask HN / Show HN in Your Domain**
- Filter: Ask HN or Show HN with semantic match to your topics
- Why: Lower barrier, people explicitly want feedback
- Action prompt: "This person is asking for X. You have experience with Y."

#### 2. **Unanswered Questions You Can Solve**
- Filter: Stories with <10 comments, asking a question you can answer
- Why: Early engagement = more visibility, OP appreciation
- Action prompt: "2 comments so far. You could explain Z."

#### 3. **Debates You Can Clarify**
- Filter: Stories with 50+ comments but contentious/confused discussion
- Why: Framework-bringer role. You provide the mental model.
- Action prompt: "Debate on X. You could add systems perspective on Y."

#### 4. **Stories You Can Extend**
- Filter: Stories related to your blog posts or projects
- Why: Natural self-promotion + value-add
- Action prompt: "Related to your post on [topic]. Link + add insight?"

#### 5. **High-Karma Author Threads**
- Filter: Authors with >5k karma discussing your topics
- Why: Network building. These people have reach.
- Action prompt: "Author has 12k karma, wrote about X before. Conversation starter?"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Filtering (Week 1-2)
```python
# Add to process_digest.py
def find_engagement_opportunities(stories, user_profile):
    opportunities = []
    
    # Ask HN / Show HN
    for story in stories:
        if story['title'].startswith(('Ask HN:', 'Show HN:')):
            opportunities.append({
                'type': 'ask_show',
                'story': story,
                'why': 'Direct request for feedback',
                'action': generate_action_prompt(story)
            })
    
    # Low comment count (early engagement)
    for story in stories:
        if story['descendants'] < 10:
            opportunities.append({
                'type': 'early',
                'story': story,
                'why': 'Early conversation, high visibility',
                'action': generate_action_prompt(story)
            })
    
    return opportunities[:3]  # Top 3 per day
```

### Phase 2: Comment Analysis (Week 3-4)
- Fetch top-level comments for matched stories
- Identify unanswered questions
- Detect debate/confusion signals
- Rank by engagement potential

### Phase 3: Context Enrichment (Month 2)
- Cross-reference with your blog posts
- Match stories to your project domains
- Suggest specific angles/frameworks to contribute

## Engagement Workflow

### Daily Flow
1. **Receive digest at 2 PM**
2. **Scan engagement section** (30 seconds)
3. **Pick one opportunity** (quality > quantity)
4. **Draft comment in context** (5 minutes)
5. **Post within 2 hours** (while story is hot)

### Weekly Flow
- Track engagement: which comments got replies, upvotes
- Identify successful patterns (Ask HN > debates? Early > late?)
- Refine opportunity detection

### Monthly Flow
- Review reputation growth (karma, profile views if trackable)
- Identify authors you've connected with
- Plan deeper engagement (DMs, collaborations)

---

## Engagement Scoring

Rank opportunities by:
```
score = (topic_match × 0.4) + 
        (timing_factor × 0.3) + 
        (author_reputation × 0.2) + 
        (comment_potential × 0.1)

topic_match: semantic similarity to your interests (0-1)
timing_factor: recency + comment velocity (0-1)
author_reputation: karma / 10000, capped at 1
comment_potential: has it sparked debate? unanswered questions?
```

Top 3 scores → digest

## Tactical Templates

### For Ask HN
> "I dealt with [their problem] when [your context]. What worked: [specific framework/approach]. Key trade-off: [nuance they might miss]."

### For Show HN
> "Interesting approach to [their goal]. Have you considered [your perspective]? I explored this in [your project/post], found [specific insight]."

### For Debates
> "This thread is circling [confusion point]. Useful frame: [your mental model]. It explains why [clarification]."

### For Extensions
> "Related: [your blog post/project]. I found [specific finding]. Your angle on [their topic] connects to [bridge insight]."

---

## Success Metrics (3 Months)

- **Volume:** 3-5 comments/week (not daily spam)
- **Quality:** Avg 3+ upvotes per comment
- **Reach:** 2-3 replies per comment (sparked conversation)
- **Network:** 5+ high-karma authors engaged with
- **Compounding:** 1-2 DMs or follow-on connections

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Don't:**
- Comment just to comment (lowers signal)
- Self-promote without value-add
- Engage in low-quality debates
- Chase karma (chase insight)

**Do:**
- Skip days if no high-quality opportunities
- Provide frameworks, not opinions
- Link to your work only when genuinely relevant
- Build relationships, not just thread count

## Integration with Existing System

### Database Schema Addition
```sql
-- Add to hn_digest_v2.db
CREATE TABLE engagement_opportunities (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    story_id INTEGER,
    detected_date TEXT,
    opportunity_type TEXT,
    score REAL,
    action_prompt TEXT,
    engaged BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    engagement_date TEXT,
    comment_url TEXT,
    karma_gained INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (story_id) REFERENCES stories(id)
);

CREATE TABLE engagement_stats (
    date TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    opportunities_detected INTEGER,
    opportunities_engaged INTEGER,
    total_karma_gained INTEGER,
    replies_received INTEGER
);
```

### Digest Format Update
```
🎯 Engagement Opportunities

1. [Ask HN] Best practices for knowledge graphs in production (8 comments, 2h old)
   → Early conversation. You have deployment experience. Add architectural insight?
   https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345

2. Discussion: ML model monitoring drift (45 comments, debate on metrics)
   → People conflating concept drift vs data drift. You could clarify.
   https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=67890

3. [Show HN] Personal AI assistant (3 comments, author=12k karma)
   → Relates to your OpenClaw setup. Share lessons learned?
   https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11223
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add opportunity detection to `process_digest.py`** (basic filters first)
2. **Update digest format** in `send_digest.py` (add engagement section)
3. **Track engagement** in SQLite (record when you comment)
4. **Iterate on scoring** based on what opportunities you actually engage with
5. **Weekly review** - what worked, what didn't

_Built for leverage: automated opportunity detection, frictionless engagement, reputation compounding._
